# This is a collection of supervised and unsupervised learning methods
***********************************************************************
This repository has 3 goals: 
1. This is a collection of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.
2. This is a repository to practice, revise modular coding and python scripting.
3. This will explain the difference between traditional notebooks, python scripting and modeular coding.

=> src/supervised_regression.py file contains most of the very common regression models.
=> src/supervised_classification.py file contains most of the very common classification models.

## Getting Started.
******************
Step 1: Clone the Repository:

"git clone https://github.com/surajprakash-data-science/The_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_repo"

Step 2: Set up the Environment

Install the required dependencies:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

## How to Use.
*************
You can run the inference script from your terminal to get recipe recommendations.

"python src/supervised_regression.py"
